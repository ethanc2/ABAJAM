This directory contains the Unity scene files for the ABA Jam game.

The following scenes are included:
1. TeamSelectionScene.unity - For selecting teams before a game
2. GameModeSelectionScene.unity - For choosing between 2v2 match or 3-point contest
3. MainGameScene.unity - The main 2v2 basketball gameplay scene
4. ThreePointContestScene.unity - The 3-point shooting contest mode

When you open the project in Unity, these scene files will be properly initialized.
You should open the TeamSelectionScene first, as it's the starting point of the game.
